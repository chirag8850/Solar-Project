          <h1>Why it is important to clean solar panel ?</h1>
          <p class="importance">
            If you had installed solar panels on your home or business, as you
            are already aware of the saving and efficiency of solar panels.
            Solar panel cleaning is a mandatory to keep the system efficient as
            per system design. The dirtier a solar panel becomes less efficient
            and which can cost your money in the long run. Clean solar panel
            gives you 16 % Efficiency as committed by the manufacturer. Solar
            Panel cleaning plays a very important role in generation of solar
            power system.

              The more light that hits a panel, the more power it will generate.
              One of main issue with solar panels is the attraction of birds.
              Bird droppings can also compromise the efficiency of your solar
              Power system. As Solar Panel is in open areas or rooftop so dust
              will start to settle on them which block sunlight and start
              reducing their efficiency. There are different possibilities of
              efficiency drop when solar panel is not cleaned.

            <h1>Working diagram of solar pannel cleanning system</h1>
            <p>
              The system consists of water Solar Pump and a device. There is
              water spraying nozzles on the top of every panel that will spray
              high pressure water on the panel in order to clean it. The device
              has a microcontroller unit which is programmed such that, the
              whole water pressure, created by Solar Pump, is applied to each
              and every water spraying section individually. So highpressure
              water is sprayed to every solar panels row one by one in order to
              clean every panels in solar power plant. The device also consist a
              timer which enable system on/off automatically to this system.
